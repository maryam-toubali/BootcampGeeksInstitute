üîÅ What Are Loops?
Loops let you repeat a block of code multiple times instead of writing it again and again.

1Ô∏è‚É£ For Loops for x in group = anything that can be iterated Lists, Tuples, Strings, Dictionaries, Sets, Ranges, zip, enumerate, map, filter ‚Äî they all have __iter__() method
   _ The word 'for' is like a machine. It takes one item at a time from a group and puts it into the variable you chose ‚Äî like x
   _ Used to repeat actions a specific number of times or go through each item in a group.
   _ Using for: What group are we looping through? What is the loop doing with each item?
   

2Ô∏è‚É£ Ranges range(start, end)
The range() function creates a list of numbers. The end value is not included.

3Ô∏è‚É£ While Loops (while condition)
Repeat as long as a condition is True.

‚ö† Using a Flag
You can control the loop with a variable (called a flag)
