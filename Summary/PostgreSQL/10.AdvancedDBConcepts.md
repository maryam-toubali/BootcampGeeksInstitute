| **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**       | Visual representation of entities (tables) and their relationships.   | Shows how tables are related. Each table is an entity, and arrows show foreign key relationships.                                                       |
| **ORM (Object Relational Mapper)**          | Maps database tables to programming language objects.                 | Example: SQLAlchemy (Python). Lets you use classes and objects to interact with database rows.                                                          |
| **Transactions**                            | A set of operations performed as a single unit.                       | Ensures changes are made completely or not at all. Example: INSERT + UPDATE + DELETE as one transaction.                                                |
| **MVCC (Multiversion Concurrency Control)** | Allows multiple users to read and write without locking the database. | Each user sees their own version of the data until a transaction is committed.                                                                          |
| **ACID**                                    | Properties ensuring safe and consistent transactions.                 | **A**tomicity, **C**onsistency, **I**solation, **D**urability.                                                                                          |
| **Data Integrity**                          | Ensures accuracy and consistency of data.                             | - **Entity**: No duplicate rows<br>- **Domain**: Valid data types<br>- **Referential**: Foreign keys must exist<br>- **User-Defined**: Custom rules     |
| **Database Normalization**                  | Organizing data to reduce redundancy.                                 | Example: Storing users and orders in separate tables, not repeating user info in each order.                                                            |
| **Primary Key**                             | A unique identifier for each row in a table.                          | Example: `user_id`, `product_id`. Cannot be NULL and must be unique.                                                                                    |
| **Relational Databases**                    | Databases organized by related tables.                                | Tables are linked using primary keys and foreign keys. Example: users, stocks, and user\_stocks tables.                                                 |
| **Aggregation**                             | SQL operations that summarize data, like SUM, AVG, COUNT.             | Use `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` for filtered group results.                                                                                                 |
| **Example Query**                           | Shows how to use joins and filtering.                                 | `sql<br>SELECT first_name, email FROM users<br>JOIN user_stocks ON user_id = users.id<br>JOIN stocks ON stock_id = stocks.id<br>WHERE symbol = 'GOOG';` |
