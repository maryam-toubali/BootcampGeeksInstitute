## üîë What Are **Tokens**?

A **token** is like a **digital key** that proves who you are when you talk to a computer system.

When you log in to your account on a website, the site needs a way to remember that **you are you**.

Instead of logging in every time, you get a **token** (like a secret pass).
It‚Äôs just a **long string** ‚Äî sent with every request ‚Äî that says:
‚úÖ "Yes, this user is logged in."

We use something called **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for this.

### Why Do We Need Tokens?

Imagine you log in to an app (like Instagram). The app needs to remember that **you** are you ‚Äî without asking your username and password every time you click something.

Tokens are:

* **Proof** you‚Äôre logged in
* A way to **securely identify you** without sharing your password repeatedly
* Usually **short-lived** so they expire and can‚Äôt be misused forever

## üîç How Tokens Work in APIs (like JWT)

1. **User logs in** with username + password.
2. Server checks credentials, and if correct:
3. Server sends back a **token** (usually a JWT - JSON Web Token).
4. Your app stores this token (in browser local storage or app memory).
5. When you make a request (like add a book), your app sends the token in the request header (usually `Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
6. Server **checks the token** to make sure you‚Äôre allowed to do that action.
7. If valid, the server processes the request; if not, it rejects it.

## üß© What‚Äôs Inside a JWT Token?

A JWT has **3 parts**, separated by dots:

| Part      | What It Contains                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Header    | Info about how the token is signed               |
| Payload   | Data like user ID, username, roles, expiry       |
| Signature | A secure hash to verify the token wasn't changed |

---

## üéØ Why JWT Tokens Are Popular

* They are **stateless**: server doesn‚Äôt need to store session info.
* They carry **user info securely** inside the token.
* Easy to use in APIs across different platforms.

## Example: Using a Token in API Request

```http
GET /books HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6...
```

### TL;DR:

| **Token**          | **Like**                                      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| What is it?        | A **digital key** proving who you are         |
| Why use it?        | So you don‚Äôt need to log in again & again     |
| JWT                | A popular type of token with info inside      |
| Sent with requests | In the `Authorization` header as "Bearer ..." |
