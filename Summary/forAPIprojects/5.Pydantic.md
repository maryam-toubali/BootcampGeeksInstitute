### **What is Pydantic models (Schema.py)?**

When data comes into your API (like a review or signup form), FastAPI needs to **check itâ€™s valid**.

We use `schemas.py` (Pydantic models) to say:

> "This is what valid data should look like."

Example:

```python
class BookCreate(BaseModel):
    title: str
    author: str
```

That means: a book **must have** a title and author, both as strings.
