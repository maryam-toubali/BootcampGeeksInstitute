### **What is SQLAlchemy (models.py)?**

SQLAlchemy lets you write Python code to talk to a database.

You define your **tables** in `models.py` like this:

```python
class Book(Base):
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = Column(String)
```

This is just like saying:

> “I want a table called `books` with a column `title`”.
