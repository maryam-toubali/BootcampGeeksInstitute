## 🌐 What is HTTP?

HTTP is the **language** your browser uses to **talk to websites (servers)**.

* When you go to a website, your browser **sends a message** to the server (called a **request**).
* The server **replies** with a message back (called a **response**).

🧠 Think of it like:

> You (browser) ask a question → Server answers.

## 🔁 HTTP is "Stateless"

* This means **each request is separate**.
* The server **doesn’t remember you** between requests unless you use something like **cookies** or **sessions**.

---

## 📩 Two Main Types of HTTP Messages

1. **Request** – sent by the browser (you) to ask the server for something.
2. **Response** – sent by the server back to your browser.

---

## ✋ HTTP Methods

These are **verbs** that tell the server **what you want to do**.

### 1. **GET**

* You want to **get (read)** information.
* Example: when you visit a page.
* ❗ Not secure – all data is visible in the URL.
* ✅ Can be bookmarked.

Example:

```
GET /page.html?name=Sara&age=30
```

---

### 2. **POST**

* You want to **send** or **upload** data to the server.
* Example: submitting a form.
* ✅ Safer – data is hidden in the **body** (not in the URL).

---
| Method | Data location       | Visible in URL? | Secure? | Use when...            |
| ------ | ------------------- | --------------- | ------- | ---------------------- |
| GET    | In the URL          | ✅ Yes           | ❌ No    | Getting/searching data |
| POST   | In the request body | ❌ No            | ✅ Yes   | Sending sensitive data |


## 🧱 Structure of a Request

### 1. **Start Line**

Tells the server:

* What method (GET or POST)?
* What file or page?
* What version of HTTP?

Example:

```
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
```

---

### 2. **Headers**

Gives extra info:

* Who is making the request?
* What format is accepted?
* Cookies, languages, etc.

Example:

```
User-Agent: Chrome
Accept-Language: en-US
```

---

### 3. **Body**

Only used with some methods like **POST**.
It contains the **real data** you're sending (like a form, JSON, etc.).

---

## ✅ Example of a Full Request:

```http
GET /hello.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Chrome
```

---

## 📬 HTTP Response (What the server sends back)

### 1. **Status Line**

* HTTP version
* Status code (like 200 or 404)
* Status text

Example:

```
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
```

### 2. **Headers**

Example:

```
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1024
```

### 3. **Body**

Contains the actual **webpage content** (HTML, text, image, etc.)

## 🔢 Common HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Meaning                                  |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 200  | ✅ OK – Everything worked                 |
| 404  | ❌ Not Found – Page missing               |
| 500  | 🔧 Server Error                          |
| 401  | 🔐 Unauthorized – Login needed           |
| 403  | 🚫 Forbidden – You don’t have permission |

---

## 🧠 Final Summary

* HTTP = browser and server talking using **requests** and **responses**.
* You use **methods** like GET and POST to send data.
* Requests and responses have a **start line**, **headers**, and sometimes a **body**.
* Status codes tell you if something worked (200) or not (404, 500, etc.).
