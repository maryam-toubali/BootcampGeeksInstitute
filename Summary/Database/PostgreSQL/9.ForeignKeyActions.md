### General Syntax (used inside a `CREATE TABLE` for foreign keys)

```sql
REFERENCES parent_table(column) ON DELETE <ACTION> ON UPDATE <ACTION>
```

### ðŸ”½ Summary Table (With Short Explanations and Simple Examples)

CREATE TABLE teachers (
  teacher_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE students (
  student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  teacher_id INTEGER REFERENCES teachers(teacher_id) ON DELETE <ACTION>
);


| Action        | What It Does                                              | Example Scenario                                  |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `RESTRICT`    | Prevents deleting/updating parent if used in child table  | You can't delete a color if any car uses it       |
| `CASCADE`     | Deletes/updates child rows automatically                  | Deleting a color also deletes all cars using it   |
| `SET NULL`    | Sets the child column to `NULL`                           | Car keeps existing, but `car_color` becomes NULL  |
| `SET DEFAULT` | Sets the child column to its default value                | After deleting color, carâ€™s color becomes default |
| `NO ACTION`   | Like `RESTRICT` but checks happen at the end of the query | Similar to RESTRICT, but check is delayed         |
