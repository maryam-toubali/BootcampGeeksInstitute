### **What is Middleware?**

Middleware is **code that runs before your route logic**.

In this project, the middleware:

* **Looks for the token** in the request
* **Checks if it’s valid**
* If valid ➜ it lets you access the route
* If not ➜ it stops you with an error

So middleware is like a **security guard** at the door.
