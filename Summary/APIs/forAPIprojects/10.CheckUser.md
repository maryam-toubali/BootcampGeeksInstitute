## `dependencies.py` – "How we check the current user"

This handles:

* Getting the current user from the token
* Making sure the user is authenticated
* Checking if the user is an admin

### 🔐 Example:

```python
from fastapi import Request, HTTPException, Depends
from .database import SessionLocal
from . import crud
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()

def get_current_user(request: Request):
    user = request.state.user
    if not user:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Not authenticated")
    return user

def get_admin_user(user = Depends(get_current_user)):
    if user["role"] != "admin":
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Admin access required")
    return user
```

### 🧾 What does this do?

* `get_current_user`: Reads the user from the **JWT token** (stored in the request by middleware)
* `get_admin_user`: Makes sure the user is an admin before doing admin-only actions
